# Router

`router.js` is a simple router and `window.history` manager that falls back to using hashtags for browsers that don’t support the history object. Routes can be defined as simple strings or complex regular expressions.


## Example Usage

## Syntax

## Dependencies

`router.js` assumes the presence of the [jQuery](http://jquery.com)’s event object. If you do not wish to include jQuery in your project, it should be fairly trivial to change the few dependences to another event dispatcher.


## License

`router.js` can be used freely for any open source or commercial works and is released under a [MIT license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).
